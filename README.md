# This code produces a random quote using the quotable API (https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction) and turns it into RGB values, which are used for creating an image.
# The code for image generation is based off of this example using matplotlib: https://shamsfiroz.medium.com/creating-generative-art-with-numpy-737a9af8ffda

# It uses the notebook format, so that new images can be generated without running the entire code again.
